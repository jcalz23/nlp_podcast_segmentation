And I know we've talked about this a lot, \"\n"," 'but I think it bears repeating. The accidental discovery of LSD of acid. '\n"," \"Yeah. Probably one of the funniest things that's ever happened to a chemist \"\n"," 'ever. Yeah, sure. Albie Hoffman, back in, I think, like, 1929, he started '\n"," 'working at Sandos Pharmaceuticals in Switzerland, and he decided he was '\n"," \"going to get to the bottom of Argott and ergot. It's a mold, I believe, or \"\n"," \"fungus. I'm sorry, that grows on rye in particular, and has long been known \"\n"," 'to make people do crazy, weird stuff. And they think that maybe the Salem '\n"," 'witch trials were the result of ergot poisoning. Sure. Or the Enlightenment '\n"," \"was the result of air got poisoning. It's possible. A lot of quote unquote \"\n"," 'poisoning. Right. Ergot craziness albie Hoffman is trying to albie? Like '\n"," \"albie? Yeah, he's dead. He can't hear me. Okay. He was trying to figure out \"\n"," \"what you can do with this. He's been studying it for a while, and he came up \"\n"," 'with lysergic acid diplytomide, and he made several attempts at it. And on '\n"," 'his derivative LSD 25, he got some on his hands, I guess, ingested it '\n"," 'somehow. Yeah, fingertips. So he has it on his fingers? Yes. And he goes '\n"," 'home to lay down. He starts seeing, like, fractals and colors and a '\n"," 'kaleidoscope. And it interested him, I guess you could say. Sure. So he '\n"," 'started researching heavily, like injecting it and getting bike rides from '\n"," 'his assistant and all that stuff. Yeah, he took it on accident, and then '\n"," 'three days later, he was like, Maybe I should try that for real. And then he '\n"," 'got a ride home on the bike from his assistant. And April 16 is now referred '\n"," 'to as Bicycle Day. About those hippies. Yeah. And one of his quotes that I '\n"," 'thought was really great when he first described it, he said it was, quote, '\n"," 'a not unpleasant intoxicated, like, state. Yeah. And that was on the first '\n"," 'time. Apparently the bicycle trip got a little hairy. Oh, really? Yeah. But '\n"," 'then he passed through that wave into the wave of not unpleasant once again. '\n"," 'Right. And then he started wearing Captain. So it was an accidental '\n"," 'discovery of the nature of the psychedelic nature. And he said we should '\n"," 'start using this stuff for, like, medicine. Yeah, well, the hippies had '\n"," 'other ideas. Yeah, sure. He ultimately referred to LSD as his problem child. '\n"," 'He wrote a book called My Problem Child in I think it was kind of one of '\n"," \"those ones where it's like, you're my problem child. Come here. Here's some \"\n"," \"money. He wrote that 1980? Wow. Yeah, I believe so. Boy, I didn't realize he \"\n"," \"lived that long. That's pretty cool. Yeah, he was an old guy. Well, I mean, \"\n"," \"he drank a tablespoon of LSD every day, and that's what gave him his \"\n"," \"longevity, I think. So that's number one, right? Or that's actually number \"\n"," \"ten. That was the intro. Well, it counts. I don't think it should count. So \"\n"," \"you got another one then? An extra? Yeah, I'll just make it up, apparently, \"\n"," 'is what we do. Josh number nine, Cornflakes, is fictionalized in the TC. '\n"," \"Boyle book the road to wellville, was that a TC? Boy? Yeah. I didn't know \"\n"," \"that. He's great. Oh, I love him. Did you see the movie? Yeah. I've not seen \"\n"," 'the movie or read the book. Yeah. Matthew Broderick, Anthony Hopkins. Yes, '\n"," \"it was good. I've been to Battle Creek before then. Oh, you really have? \"\n"," \"Yeah, when I was a kid. And that's the home of cereals, right? Kellogg's \"\n"," \"Cereals, basically. Kellogg's Cereal. Here we go. Wilkeath Kellogg, he was \"\n"," 'interested in medicine and he was working as a doctor at the Battle Creek '\n"," 'Sanitarium with his brother, helping him out with and this is in the movie '\n"," 'with their diets. He was trying all sorts of weird treatments. Big on '\n"," 'animals. Oh, yeah. Huge on animals. He also discovered or created the first '\n"," 'acidophilus, soy milk. Oh, really? Yeah, and some sort of meat alternative '\n"," 'that ultimately led something to something like American Tofu or something. '\n"," 'Yeah. Boy, what a genius. And he is responsible by accident for cornflakes. '\n"," \"Oh, will was and I'm sorry, John Harvey, his brother, was responsible for \"\n"," 'those two things. Well, it runs in the family. Yeah. He was making bread one '\n"," 'day at the old sanitarium there in Battle Creek. He left boiled wheat '\n"," 'sitting out for a little too long. And he came back and he rolled into the '\n"," 'dough and it became flaky, which is not what he was looking for. But he was '\n"," \"like, you know what? I'm going to throw this in the oven. Anyway, let me see \"\n"," 'what happens. And it baked these little flakes that the patients here were '\n"," 'like, boy, these are delicious. We should pour some milk over this stuff and '\n"," 'cut a banana into it. Yeah. And put it in a box. Can we get some free '\n"," 'striped strawberries added? Exactly. And eventually he tinkered with it and '\n"," 'switched it over to corn as the main ingredients of wheat. And that was '\n"," \"cornflakes, my friend. That's how I took off. What's he added or used corn? \"\n"," \"I'm sure it was kind of like, this isn't good, but what is this weedies? \"\n"," 'These are terrible. Yeah, exactly. And then he tried it with corn and they '\n"," \"were like, oh, that's really good. And that formed the Battle Creek Toasted \"\n"," \"Cornflakes Company, which eventually became Kellogg's accidental serious \"\n"," 'whenever he came up with the Battle Creek Toasted Cornflakes Company name. '\n"," \"Yeah. You know, he's wearing spats. That name just like Scream spats. What \"\n"," 'are spats? The little white covers that go over your shoes. Yeah. Like Mr. '\n"," 'Monopoly or Buster. Still learning that terrible movie gangster. Yeah. '\n"," 'Oscar. Yeah. I thought stats might have been the little sock leggings, but '\n"," 'those are probably just called socket leggings. I think those are called '\n"," 'spenders or garters. Yeah, we should bring that back. No, this died out for '\n"," \"good reason. All right, moving on. Or do you have any other Kellogg's fax? I \"\n"," \"have neither Kellogg's fax nor anymore spats jokes. So I think we should go \"\n"," 'on because this next one is dynamite, named for the Greek root meaning '\n"," 'connected with power. Alfred Nobel, Swedish scientist, accidentally '\n"," 'discovered dynamite when he was working on basically with nitroglycerin. '\n"," \"He's working on explosives, trying to make it stable. Well, his father built \"\n"," 'mines. Is that how that started? And you build mines using explosives, '\n"," 'specifically nitroglycerin. But back then it was kind of like, okay, 80 '\n"," 'people died because of nitroglycerin. Just exploded because someone looked '\n"," 'at it wrong. Well, because we have it in a jar in the back of a horse cart. '\n"," \"Right. That's part of the problem, too. But he lost a brother and three \"\n"," 'other people at his lab in Stockholm when he was trying to figure out how to '\n"," 'stabilize it. Very sad. But he kept with it. And so in the article, it says '\n"," 'that he was transporting it and saw it packed in this stuff, this mud that '\n"," \"we like to call keeslegur. Yeah, right. But I read elsewhere that it wasn't \"\n"," 'that ultimately he came up with using Keysl ger. Yeah, I read that he '\n"," \"dropped it on the sawdust. That's what I read. He thought he was going to \"\n"," 'die as he watched this vial fall of nitroglycerin fall out of his hand, but '\n"," \"it landed on sawdust and was absorbed. And he went, that's weird. So he \"\n"," 'started studying. If you mixed it with an inert material, you could '\n"," 'conceivably blast it by adding a fuse to it. He finally came up with Keysel '\n"," \"Ger, which is like this it's like sedimentary mud. Right? Yeah. It's real \"\n"," \"powdery. It's a combination of crushed fossil and marine life. Got you. It's \"\n"," \"what they use actually, you'll probably see it. It's what they use on film \"\n"," \"sets when they want to make stuff look dirty. Oh, okay. Because it's just, \"\n"," 'like super light and powdery and makes it look really super dirty. Got you. '\n"," \"Yeah. Keel ger. Yeah. Fuller's earth. Well, he also there would be \"\n"," 'something. He figured out how to stabilize nitroglycerin and created a '\n"," 'stable explosive. Sure. But he combined it with another previous invention '\n"," 'of his based on the initial ignition principle, which is not just using a '\n"," 'fuse, but having a fuse go to a blasting cap and having a smaller explosive '\n"," 'blow up your bigger explosive. Yeah. He put all that together. And that was '\n"," 'dynamite. Truly dynamite. It was. Again, he was doing this to build minds. '\n"," 'But in his lifetime, he saw his invention used to destroy human lives. Yeah, '\n"," 'he blew up a lot of things himself by accident. A lot of his factories. It '\n"," \"wasn't just that one time. No. Yeah. They basically said, you can't do this \"\n"," 'anymore on the mainland. So you started working on a barge. Yeah. And I '\n"," \"think the barge might have even blown up. I'm sure everything blew up. He \"\n"," \"was like King Midas, but everything exploded. That's right. So as part of \"\n"," 'his legacy, he created the Nobel Peace Prize. Right. Well, I guess he '\n"," 'bequeathed it to basically say, hey, a lot of people have died because of my '\n"," \"invention, so let's promote safety and harmony and peace. And then later the \"\n"," 'IG Nobels. Yeah. Which kind of brought it full circle, in a way. They did. '\n"," \"He first named it Nobel's Blasting Powder. Then eventually it became \"\n"," \"dynamite. Not to be confused with TNT. It's different. Okay, so AC DC was \"\n"," \"wrong. TNT I'm dynamite. It's not true. I know what you're saying. What they \"\n"," \"should have said was TNT, I'm not quite Dynamite, or I'm less effective than \"\n"," 'Dynamite. That should have been the song. So what is TNT then? Dynamite is '\n"," \"60% greater energy than TNT. Wow. So it's two totally different things. It's \"\n"," \"not just like a lesser degraded version. They're both high explosives, \"\n"," 'meaning they detonate instead of, like, burning. Yeah, but yeah, two '\n"," 'different things. So Fan Scott, he was on the drink, as we all found out. '\n"," 'Really? Like, he died because of the drink. The dude with the hat? Yeah, '\n"," \"that's the second guy. Brian Johnson, the first lead singer for the first \"\n"," 'however many albums died in his car. He passed out after a night drinking '\n"," 'and did the old choke on the vomit thing. But he was the one that sang TNT '\n"," 'Dynamite. I thought those two guys were like, what? I thought TNT and '\n"," 'Dynamite were up until a minute ago. Now. Brian Johnson came along later. '\n"," 'Back in Black was his first album, so all that good early AC DC ponscon. '\n"," 'What do you think about Sammy Hagar? A summer is here, my friend, which '\n"," 'means school is out, the sun is shining bright, the days are longer, and '\n"," \"best of all, there's plenty of time to get lost in a good, thrilling story. \"\n"," \"Yeah.

His quote, he was saying, like, I've made many discoveries in my \"\n"," \"search for coal tar, some of them accidentally, and here's one, but he \"\n"," \"doesn't say, like, what I was doing was synthesizing chemicals in a search \"\n"," \"for substitute for coal tar. So I'm not going to stand 100% behind it, but \"\n"," \"that's what I think. Right. He said he was in a great hurry and left the lab \"\n"," \"without washing his hands. Apparently, he wasn't wearing gloves or anything \"\n"," \"either while he was working in the lab with these chemicals that he didn't \"\n"," 'know what they were. And he went home and he ate dinner. Right. And he was '\n"," 'eating a piece of bread, and his bread was really sweet, and he realized '\n"," 'that that was weird. So he put the bread down and wiped his hands in his '\n"," 'mouth and his beard with the napkin. The napkin is sweet. Yes. He thought '\n"," \"the napkin was super sweet. And he's like, okay, there's something weird \"\n"," 'going on. He put two and two together and realized it must have been that '\n"," 'powder that he had on his hands from the chemical that he spilled on it that '\n"," \"he didn't think to wash off before he ate with his hands. Exactly. And it \"\n"," 'turned out to be Saccharine. So what does he do? Well, he says, I can '\n"," \"probably make some money off this, and I'm under the impression that he shut \"\n"," 'out Remsen. So what he did was Remsen was a total research. He was a total '\n"," \"lab rat. He didn't care a thing about patents, and he was apparently fine \"\n"," 'with the idea that Falberg went off and independently patented it. Until it '\n"," 'started making money. No, until he started telling people that he was the '\n"," 'one that created this thing. He was the senior researcher right then. Now '\n"," \"he's screwing with Remsen's lab rat status. That's when Remsen was like, \"\n"," \"Shut your mouth. So it didn't have as much to do with money. No. His rep. \"\n"," 'Exactly. Interesting. Yeah. So Falberg ended up with the patent for '\n"," 'saccharin, and years and years and years later, the 80s happened. People are '\n"," \"all coked up. They're looking for ways to lose some weight, and Sweet and \"\n"," \"Low comes along. It's saccharin. And it has so few calories in it, \"\n"," \"apparently five calories a gram that it's just listed as zero calories \"\n"," 'because those packets are a lot less than a gram. Yeah. And the reason why '\n"," \"it's non caloric is because it's never metabolized by the body. It just goes \"\n"," 'out the way in the same format came in. Yeah. It has zero food energy value. '\n"," \"It's like if you were trapped, freezing in the woods and you had a big \"\n"," \"bucket of Sweet and Low, it wouldn't be the same as if you had a big bucket \"\n"," \"of sugar. Yeah. You'd want the big bucket of sugar trapped in the woods with \"\n"," 'a big bucket of sugar, huh? Well, you get food energy. Okay. Trapped in the '\n"," \"woods with a big bucket of sweet and latter you're screwed. Yeah. Can you \"\n"," 'imagine, like, the fuzzy jackets on your teeth after eating a bucket of '\n"," \"sugar in the woods? Since it was brought on the scene, it's kind of been \"\n"," \"added and removed quite a few times, too. You can eat this, it's fine. And \"\n"," \"it's probably not great for you list, but right now it's in good standing. \"\n"," 'It is approved because I remember in the late eighties, early nineties, like '\n"," 'after everybody had been drinking it for a while, they took like a hard look '\n"," \"at Saccharin and we're like, well, it may cause cancer in laboratory. I put \"\n"," \"it in my unsweet iced tea I've seen because that's the only thing I can \"\n"," \"find, that you put sugar in there and it just sinks to the bottom. That's \"\n"," 'why you have to use simple syrup. Yeah. Or put the sugar in the hot brewed '\n"," \"tea where it will melt. But if it dissolves, if you're not going to do that, \"\n"," 'then you simple syrup is fine. It works really well. Or just drink unsweet '\n"," \"tea, for God's sake. I'm on an UN sweet tea kick right now. A little lemon. \"\n"," \"Yeah, see, I like the sweet tea. Or if I drink green tea, obviously that's \"\n"," 'just straight up. Yeah. Not the same. Have you ever had this oolong tea? '\n"," \"Yeah, sure. Yeah. That is something OOlala. It's crazy. All right, Josh, I \"\n"," \"didn't think the microwave I feel like we've talked about that before, like \"\n"," \"800 times. We have, yeah. So let's skip it. Okay. Viagra? Yeah. I hadn't \"\n"," \"heard of this one. I didn't realize it was accidental. You haven't heard of \"\n"," \"viagra? Please. I've heard of Viagra, yes. I haven't heard of the story \"\n"," \"behind it. Got you. I see what you're insinuating. How's McCoy, Simon \"\n"," 'Campbell and David Roberts were researching for Pfizer, trying to develop '\n"," 'some blood pressure and heart medication for angina. And they tested it on '\n"," 'people doing some trials. And these guys were all like, I still have some '\n"," 'angina and I have a massive erection, which is a weird side effect. You '\n"," 'might want to look into this. Yeah. And they did, and they went, wow, this '\n"," 'could pay dividends in the invalid. Yeah. They basically said, okay, FDA, '\n"," \"forget everything we said, forget the angina. We're just going to stick to \"\n"," \"amyl nitrate. Yeah. Instead, we're going to start over, do more clinical \"\n"," \"trials, but we're going to use to treat Ed and we're going to target \"\n"," 'handsome, salt and pepper haired men of a certain age who like to bathe in '\n"," 'bathtubs outdoors next to their partners who are also in bathtubs watching '\n"," \"sunrise. That is our target market. Yeah. It's all the same, though. I \"\n"," 'wonder if it is all the same. You probably just got a suit by the '\n"," \"pharmaceutical. Actually, they're not all the same. Each one has different \"\n"," \"covalent bond. I'll bet it's covalent bond. Well, they just have different \"\n"," 'properties. Some work for 24 hours, some work for 2 hours, some you take '\n"," 'every day just in case you happen to run into someone and need to have sex. '\n"," \"That's right. But all of them, no, preupism is not funny. I don't think it's \"\n"," \"funny because it's not. No, of course not. Okay. It's not. But it was \"\n"," 'popular. Sales peaked, I think, in 2008 at $1.9 billion in the US. Alone. '\n"," 'Since then, obviously, Viagra was the first on the scene, but it has been '\n"," \"chipped away at by its competitors. Like who? Cialis? And what's the other \"\n"," \"one? Davitra? Or is that heart medication? I can't keep track. I think we \"\n"," \"found that there's a fine line. Yeah. Anyway, this was originally for the \"\n"," 'treatment of angina. It works. Sure. I think that happens quite a bit, '\n"," \"actually. Well, it's all about blood flow, so yeah, it makes sense that it \"\n"," \"had that side effect, I guess. It's all about blood flow and self \"\n"," \"confidence. That's right, Pacemaker. I thought this one like my eyes started \"\n"," 'bleeding during this one. All right, we can skip it because as people know, '\n"," 'when we do our top tens, we generally do like six or seven of them. We like '\n"," \"to drive traffic to the site. That's right. Velcro. This one I have to give \"\n"," 'a shout out. I want to tell everybody. This is so amazing. So I first heard '\n"," 'the story of Velcro when I was just a young pup. The story of Velcro? Yeah. '\n"," \"You're aware, right. The real story. Yeah. Okay. Not the fake NASA story. \"\n"," 'No, not the NASA story. The George de Mastral story. He was a Swiss, swiss, '\n"," \"I don't remember what he was, but he turned out to be a Swiss inventor, \"\n"," 'electrical engineer. Okay. And he was hiking the Alps with his dog one day '\n"," 'and came home and there were birds attached to his dog. And he said, that is '\n"," \"ghastly. He said, what's going on here? Why are these birds attached to my \"\n"," \"dog? I'm going to take a closer look. And he realized that the birds were \"\n"," \"composed of little hooks and that his dog's fur were acting as little loops, \"\n"," 'and the hooks went into loops and stuck and attached. And he said, I can '\n"," \"recreate this. You know what I'll recreate it with? Nylon. And that's what \"\n"," \"he did. And that's what all Velcro is, a system of hooks and loops made of \"\n"," 'nylon. Now, I first learned that story when I was probably like, seriously '\n"," \"eleven or twelve. And I read it in Uncle John's bathroom. Reader and every \"\n"," \"Christmas I would get in a Bathroom Reader, and every like December 29, I'd \"\n"," 'be done with the 500 page Bathroom Reader. Wait, another year. Yeah, a lot. '\n"," 'Just for this reason, I would be reading this book over and over, just '\n"," \"constantly. And so one of the reasons that we're here today one of the \"\n"," \"reasons I'm here today is because my curiosity was developed and honed \"\n"," \"through Uncle John's bathroom reader. Oh, yeah. Yes. And it's been good and \"\n"," 'bad. Like, they were also where I learned that Genghis Khan supposedly '\n"," 'killed, like, 187 million people in 1 hour, which kind of led to that '\n"," 'article and all that cool. But my eyes were open. We shouted out to them, '\n"," 'like, recently, and they tweeted that we shouted out to them, and I realized '\n"," \"that they listened to this podcast. Wow. That's pretty cool. It's, like, the \"\n"," \"highest honor I have ever enjoyed as far as my career goes. That's awesome. \"\n"," 'That was it. This group that made me, in part, in large part, who I am today '\n"," \"is a fan of what we're doing. That's awesome. Yeah. I imagine Mad magazine \"\n"," 'could only come close if they got in touch with you. Yeah. They would '\n"," \"definitely be out there as well. That's awesome. Okay, so that's velcro. \"\n"," \"Yeah. And a couple of more little factoids. It's a combination of two French \"\n"," 'words velours, which means velvet, and crochet, which is hook. Yeah. And '\n"," \"velour does not breathe very well as a fabric. That's right. Nylon was very \"\n"," 'new at the time, so he had a hard time with it. And this is a lesson for all '\n"," 'your kids out there who fashion yourself or fancy yourself. Excuse me. As '\n"," \"the inventors, don't give up. It took him ten years from the moment he \"\n"," 'discovered what velcro could be till the time that he could manufacture it '\n"," 'successfully. And he worked and he worked, and he worked. Ten years later, '\n"," \"he marketed it as the Zipperless zipper. And the rest is history. And don't \"\n"," 'get cheap Velcro because you can tell the difference. Oh, man, you really '\n"," \"can. Same as cheap duct tape. You really get what you pay for. Yeah, that's \"\n"," \"definitely true. With duct tape. You don't want duct tape that doesn't have \"\n"," 'the threads clearly visible. Yes. That form, like, kind of almost the rebar '\n"," \"of it. It's exactly what it is. If you can't see it clearly, like, in the \"\n"," 'role, then just keep on moving. Little advice from your Uncle Josh, but that '\n"," 'stick to it advice. Yeah. Not the duct tape. Stick to it. Yeah. That was '\n"," \"good advice. Decade of work. Penicillin. Yeah. This one I don't think I \"\n"," 'realized penicillin was an accident. Alexander Fleming, he was a '\n"," 'bacteriologist in Scotland. He decided to get a little lazy and go on '\n"," 'vacation for two weeks. Luckily for us, in 1928. Comes home, sees a petri '\n"," \"dish with this weird mold that he hadn't seen before growing in it. And he \"\n"," \"noticed, like, there's no bacteria around this mold. Right. It was like, \"\n"," 'hugging the side of the pantry. Just like, Get it away from me. I know this '\n"," 'stuff is killing me. And he went, Well, I might be on something here. Right. '\n"," 'But the problem was the strain of penicillin mold that he discovered. He '\n"," 'left his window open the guy was a bacteriologist in the 20th century and he '\n"," 'left his window open. Right. Anyway, the mold, the strain he found was he '\n"," \"couldn't reproduce it in mass quantities, so therefore, by definition, it \"\n"," 'was useless as medicine. Sure. And then 13 years later, a trio of guys, '\n"," 'flora, Heatley and Moyer, found a strain of penicillin that they could just '\n"," 'grow very quickly in large amounts. Bam. Antibiotics. Nice. Millions and '\n"," \"millions, possibly billion LiveSave. The greed. But don't take too much of \"\n"," 'it. No, I think we prescribe it these days. You should always know your '\n"," \"limits. Yeah. No, I'm just saying I think penicillin is one of those people \"\n"," 'get thrown up penicillin and amoxicillin for everything these days. Right. '\n"," \"Well, the other part of the problem, supposedly, is that if you don't finish \"\n"," \"your course, that makes it that much easier for bacteria. Yeah, that's what \"\n"," 'I hear. Microbes to evolve immunity. Yes. I almost never finished my course, '\n"," \"though. Because you're part of the problem. Gives me bad diarrhea. Well, you \"\n"," \"need to ride it out, as they say. Get yourself an Uncle John's bathroom \"\n"," \"reader. In fact, when I'm on pennicillin, for one reason or another, I call \"\n"," 'them diarrhea pills. I have to take my diarrhea bill because I take it and '\n"," \"they say that's a possible side effect. But of course, with me, it's a \"\n"," \"certain side effect. At least you don't get preappresented from it. All \"\n"," 'right, number one, josh, the last one. I thought this was pretty interesting '\n"," 'because going back all the way to the 1008 hundreds, we used to think people '\n"," \"are all stuffy. Didn't know how to have a good time. All they did was just \"\n"," 'go to school, go to church, walk to work and study hard. Turns out that they '\n"," 'were having laughing gas parties. Yeah. In Ether Frolics. Ether Frolics. '\n"," 'Where they would sit around and suck on laughing gas and just laugh the '\n"," \"night away. Right. Which is where the phrase It's a gas comes from. That's \"\n"," \"nice. That makes sense. Sure. You're big time into entomology, aren't you? \"\n"," \"Yeah. And entomophagy. Yeah, that's right. Hey, everybody. I don't know \"\n"," \"about you, but we're pretty excited about summer. I mean, what's not to \"\n"," \"like? School's out, the sun is shining, and best of all, there's downtime \"\n"," \"for days. That's right.

'\n"," \"Went to some of these parties. I don't know if we can verify that. I have \"\n"," 'seen that they were at these parties. Okay. I went back in time and looked '\n"," 'in the way back machine.

Your show on MMJ is what some people have been calling '\n"," \"on. I always think it's like, Martin and you or something like that. It \"\n"," 'reminded me of a funny story I can share. During the early 80s, my father '\n"," \"had a rare cancer. It's even rare these days from the surprise my doctors \"\n"," \"have when I give my medical history. At one point, my dad's doctor suggested \"\n"," 'he tried marijuana to help with the chemo sickness. Of course, there was no '\n"," 'way to prescribe it back then. You had to get it on your own. My parents '\n"," 'started asking around to see whose kids could get some trustworthy stuff. '\n"," 'With no luck where we live, my mom turned to a relative who lives in another '\n"," 'state. So clearly, like the stoner cousin, like, two states over. She could '\n"," \"get it, but I don't know the details how. Probably for the best. Yeah. The \"\n"," 'next problem was how to get it to us. She often flew to visit every few '\n"," 'months, but was afraid of putting it in her luggage or mailing it. Even '\n"," 'though everybody back then, I bet. Yeah. So one of her coworkers had an '\n"," \"idea. They worked in a doctor's office and decided she would hide it between \"\n"," 'her breasts and bandage her as if she had recently had breast surgery. She '\n"," 'was sent with a note saying under no circumstances for the bandages to be '\n"," 'removed. They thought that if she was hassled the airport, a note would get '\n"," 'her out of trouble. They did this actually a few times and never got caught. '\n"," \"Oh, my God. I know. Isn't that crazy? As it turns out, my father couldn't \"\n"," 'smoke the stuff. It made him sicker. Oh, my God. I know. So he decided to '\n"," \"brew it in tea, and I'm sure there was a little baked snack put in his lunch \"\n"," 'bag every now and then. Unfortunately, my father passed away in 1084 when I '\n"," \"was 16. I wasn't completely involved in all this other stuff. The stories \"\n"," 'were retold later. There are a lot of hijinks going on in the house over '\n"," 'those years, so this is totally plausible. I remember vividly the little tee '\n"," 'ball sitting in the sink when I washed the dishes every night, asking, can I '\n"," 'clean this thing? And I would get a resounding no from about five people in '\n"," 'the house at the same time. So that is from Cindy. Cindy Brady? No, not '\n"," 'Cindy Brady. But she asked if I could read this, and she said yes. And then '\n"," 'she wrote me back and said I ended up talking with my mom about this and we '\n"," \"all had a good laugh all over again. And remember my father. Finally. That's \"\n"," 'nice.
